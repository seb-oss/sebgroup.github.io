## Functionality

This page is built using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), hosted directly from this repository. GitHub Pages uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) as the engine for building the pages. All content is written in [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

The data about SEBs projects and activity is gathered using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) which gathers information from the [sebgroup organization](https://github.com/sebgroup) every night.
